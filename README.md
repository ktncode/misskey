## âœ¨ Features
- **Sharkey-Enhanced Misskey Fork**\
This fork is modified by Kotone <git@ktn.works> and is based on Sharkey, which itself is a Misskey fork. This is NOT an official Misskey project and is maintained independently. While incorporating Sharkey's enhancements, this version maintains Misskey branding and identity purely for technical compatibility purposes - not for impersonation or to mislead users. The Nodeinfo reports as "misskey" to ensure seamless federation with ActivityPub implementations and client applications that expect standard Misskey responses, allowing users to interact with other Misskey instances without compatibility issues.
- **ActivityPub support**\
Not on Misskey? No problem! Not only can Misskey instances talk to each other, but you can make friends with people on other networks like Mastodon and Pixelfed!
- **Federated Backgrounds and Music status** (Sharkey Enhancement)\
You can add a background to your profile as well as a music status via ListenBrainz, show everyone what music you are currently listening to
- **Mastodon API** (Sharkey Enhancement)\
This fork implements the Mastodon API unlike standard Misskey
- **UI/UX Improvements** (Sharkey Enhancement)\
This fork makes some UI/UX improvements to make it easier to navigate
- **Sign-Up Approval** (Sharkey Enhancement)\
With this fork, you can enable sign-ups, subject to manual moderator approval and mandatory user-provided reasons for joining.
- **Rich Web UI**\
       Misskey has a rich and easy to use Web UI!
       It is highly customizable, from changing the layout and adding widgets to making custom themes.
       Furthermore, plugins can be created using AiScript, an original programming language.
- And much more...
