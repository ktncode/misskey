# Sharkey Logo

This logo was made in Inkscape by [@sneexy@booping.synth.download](https://booping.synth.download/@sneexy).

The font used is Lilita One ([Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lilita+One)).

## Using Inkscape

Preferably, you should use Inkscape when wanting to make modifications to the logo. Once you've made your edits, save the SVG here as is from Inkscape directly, then use [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) ([Web UI](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg), ensure `Multipass` is enabled) to produce an SVG compatible to be viewed in web browsers, which that file will then replace [`../sharkey.svg`](../sharkey.svg).

## Not using Inkscape

The logo should preferably be modified using Inkscape, but should work in any other software. If any weird issues appear, try opening it with Inkscape first or try using the version under [`../sharkey.svg`](../sharkey.svg) if you prefer to work with your software. Follow the instructions for Using Inkscape.

## Licence
