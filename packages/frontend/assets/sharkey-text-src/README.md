# Sharkey Logo

This logo was made in Inkscape by [@sneexy@booping.synth.download](https://booping.synth.download/@sneexy).

The font used is Lilita One ([Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lilita+One)).

The logo should preferably be modified using Inkscape, but should work in any other software.
If modifications were made using Inkscape, you should use [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) ([Web UI](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg), ensure `Multipass` is enabled) to produce an SVG compatible to be viewed in web browsers, which will replace then [`../sharkey.svg`](../sharkey.svg).

This logo is distributed under the same licence as Sharkey (AGPL â‰¥3).
